# From Chaos to Control

### This is a blog where I share my perspective of Reinforcement Learning (RL), as well as any research ideas. Others ML topics might be discussed too. 

## The target audience is people who are already familiar with RL. However, I'll try to approach each discussion from a first principles perspective. 

<br>
RL was the research topic during my PhD. Specifically, I focused on off-policy RL.
