# From Chaos to Control

### This is a blog where I share my perspective of Reinforcement Learning (RL), as well as any research ideas. While RL is a general paradigm and can be applied to a plethora of enviroments, I'll focus on simulated robots as robotics is an application of RL that I find fascinating and there are very realistic simulators easily available. Others Machine Learning (ML) topics might be discussed too.

The target audience is people who are already familiar with RL. However, I'll try to approach each discussion from a first principles perspective.

RL was the research topic during my PhD. Specifically, I focused on off-policy RL.
