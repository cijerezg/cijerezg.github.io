# From Chaos to Control

### This is a blog where I share my perspective of Reinforcement Learning (RL), as well as any research ideas. Others Machine Learning (ML) topics might be discussed too. While RL is a general paradigm and can be applied to a plethora of enviroments, I'll focus on simulated robots as robotics is an application of RL that I find fascinating and there are very realistic simulators easily available.
<br>
The target audience is people who are already familiar with RL. However, I'll try to approach each discussion from a first principles perspective. 
<br>
RL was the research topic during my PhD. Specifically, I focused on off-policy RL.
